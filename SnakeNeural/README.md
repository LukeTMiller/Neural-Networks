# Snake Game Neural Network:
Using Processing 3, this is a neural network that learns to play the game Snake.
 It evolves through generations using genetic algorithms.

# Inputs:
1. Press Q to see the best scoring snakes game. 
2. Press R to resume training the snakes. 

# Directions:
1. Download processing 3
2. Open "SnakeNeural" file
3. Press Run

# Information:
As the game runs, in the debug console it will display the last generation, the average fitness for that generation, the best fitness score so far and information about the top 3 snakes in that generation. 
When Q is pressed the debug console will display the snakes output for each frame.
